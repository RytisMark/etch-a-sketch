# etch-a-sketch
An Etch-a-Sketch imitation coded with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

You can change the size of the drawing board from 4x4 to 64x64, use either a pencil or an eraser, clear the board and toggle grid lines (turning the grid lines on and changing the board size makes up for a satisfying sight ðŸ˜Œ).

During the making of this project I got better at <b>manipulating elements</b> (creating, adding them, setting their classes, etc.) using DOM methods, had the chance to test out <b>CSS custom variables</b>, learned how to better handle <b>event listeners</b>, <b>styled a slider</b> for the first time, wrote more complex functions than I had before using JS and had tons of fun whilst doing so!

I plan to add a color picker in the near future!
